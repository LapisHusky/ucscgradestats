Class grade statistics at UC Santa Cruz

These are public records under the California Public Records Act. Anyone can request this data from UC Santa Cruz: https://infopractices.ucsc.edu/faqs/index.html

Pursuant to FERPA and to protect studentsâ€™ personally identifiable information, grade distributions for classes with less than 10 students, or where all students received the same grade, have been excluded from production.

In the "CPRA Responsive Records" folder are the raw files I was sent when I requested this data. At some point when I have more free time, I may run scripts to format this into JSON or something easier to process.
