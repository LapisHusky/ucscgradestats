Class grade statistics at UC Santa Cruz

These are public records under the California Public Records Act. Anyone can request this data from UC Santa Cruz: https://infopractices.ucsc.edu/faqs/index.html

Pursuant to FERPA and to protect studentsâ€™ personally identifiable information, grade distributions for classes with less than 10 students, or where all students received the same grade, have been excluded from production.

## CPRA Responsive Records
These are the raw files UCSC sent when I requested this data. At some point when I have more free time, I may run scripts to format this into JSON or something easier to process.

## tsv
These are the .xlsx files each converted to .tsv (tab separated values) by Google Sheets.

## scripts
Just contains a script to parse the tsv files into a single JSON file

## data.json
Parsed data containing all classes from all terms and their grade distributions
